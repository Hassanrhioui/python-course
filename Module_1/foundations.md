The goal of this module is to understand:

- what pythong actually is and how it runs
- know how to run scripts from terminal and vs code
- write simple programs using variable, data types, and input/output

### python is hight level programming language

what makes python very popular is its simplicity and human friendly way, also it handles low-level details.

### whee python is used:

- backend development(FastAPI, Django, Flask)
- cybersecurity scripting
- automation and DevOps
- Data analysis and machine learning
- APIs and microservices
- System tools and utilies

### Documentation of basic Python script

**_Lesson 1.2 First Python Script:_**<br>
in VScode, Let's a file called hello.py, with the following code inside it: <br> print("Hello, My name is Pypy! welcome to Python.")<br>
**_yes python is that simple, with only print() command we can print the output. _**<br>
To run this command in vs code basically we run in our terminal<br>
**_ python hello.py (name of the file) _**<br>
**_Lesson 1.3 Variables and data types_**<br>

- python has simple, dynamic variables:<br>
  example:<br>
  name = "Pypy" str meaning that "Pypy" is a tect<br>
  age = 25 int meaning that 25 is a whole number<br>
  height = 1.70 float decimals<br>
  is_student = True bool true/false<br>

from this example of variables we can write simple script:
print("My name is ", name)
print("I am", age, "years old. My height is ", height)

**_Lesson 1.4 input and output_**<br>
Python can read user input:<br>
example:<br>
name = input"(Enter your name: ")<br>
print("Hello", name)<br>
this asks the user for his name and replies with Hello + user name.
