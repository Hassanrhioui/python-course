The goal of this module is to understand:

- what pythong actually is and how it runs
- know how to run scripts from terminal and vs code
- write simple programs using variable, data types, and input/output

### python is hight level programming language

what makes python very popular is its simplicity and human friendly way, also it handles low-level details.

### whee python is used:

- backend development(FastAPI, Django, Flask)
- cybersecurity scripting
- automation and DevOps
- Data analysis and machine learning
- APIs and microservices
- System tools and utilies

### Documentation of basic Python script

**_Lesson 1.2 First Python Script_**
in VScode, Let's a file called hello.py, with the following code inside it: - print("Hello, My name is Pypy! welcome to Python.")
**_ yes python is that simple, with only print() command we can print the output. _**
To run this command in vs code basically we run in our terminal **_ python hello.py (name of the file) _**
**_Lesson 1.3 Variables and data types_**

- python has simple, dynamic variables:
  example: - name = "Pypy" str meaning that "Pypy" is a tect
  age = 25 int meaning that 25 is a whole number
  height = 1.70 float decimals
  is_student = True bool true/false

from this example of variables we can write simple script:
print("My name is ", name)
print("I am", age, "years old. My height is ", height)

**_Lesson 1.4 input and output_**
Python can read user input:
example: - name = input"(Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
this asks the user for his name and replies with Hello + user name.
